An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that can be used to access and manipulate resources or services provided by a software system. APIs are commonly used to enable integration between different systems, facilitate data exchange, and provide access to functionality or services offered by third-party providers.
